 :: Spring Boot ::        (v1.1.5.RELEASE)
```

## About

RAD framework for stand-alone (i.e. contains Tomcat) Spring applications using behind the scenes convention-over-configuration. 
Competing with Rails and in the same space as Spring Roo (difference being Boot is a configured app, while Roo merely assists in code generation).
The landscape is a bit fractured.

## Comments

* IDE couldn't generate unit tests without a class and method (hampered TDD)
* Groovy unit tests not supported by IntelliJ
* From Rails, Java is so verbose!
* Able to get a simple Hello World app running with little difficulty
