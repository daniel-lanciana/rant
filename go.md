## Go

## Install

```bash
# 1. Install Go
brew install go
# 2. Install GoLand
# 3. Go!
```

## Learnings

* Place project under `$GOPATH/src/github.com/your-username/your-repo/` (otherwise import issues)
* Import using absolution path (e.g. `github.com/foo/bar`). Checks local project path first, then globally installed packages.
* Web server built-in (`net/http`)
* Lots of single-character variable names!
* Functions need to start with an uppercase to be exportable (i.e. public) -- little bit of implicit magic..
* Set `$GOBIN` to use terminal commands
* Use `deps` for package management (places dependencies under `/vendor`) -- otherwise everything will be placed alongside your project in `$GOPATH/src/`
* Running tests not in the root `go test -v ./...`
* GoLand has good support for running, debug, tests
* Handlers == middleware. Handle and HandlerFunc are essentially the same.
* To install packages globally `go get -u github.com/package/to/install`
* gorilla libraries for logging, gzip, routing
* See all Go paths and variables: `go env`
* JSON marshaller (i.e. serializer) only serializes struct properties with capitals. Magic..
* Dep visual dependency graph: `brew install graphviz` then `dep status -dot | dot -T png | open -f -a /Applications/Preview.app`
* Mux routing allows regular expressions
* Testify assertion library
* Use `[[override]]` in `Gopkg.toml` for dev dependencies you want to include, but aren't explicity referenced in the code (to avoid it being removed on `dep ensure`)

```go
// Structs are like classes (i.e. objects)
type Person struct {
  name  string
}

// Structs can have methods (i.e. behaviors)
// Parameters after 'func' define it as an extension to that struct
func (p *Person) Speak() *Person {
  // Access to self calling object, p
  fmt.Println("Hello my name is " + p.name)
  // Return self to allow for functional chaining of calls
  return p
}
```
